# Key Naming Rules!
# - in general: shared keys should be located at their nearest ancestor
#   - keys for route templates should go in `layout`
#   - keys for components should go in `component`
# - keys specific to a file should have a matching nested key name
# - keys for intended global use (like a button component) should go in `shared`

shared:

layout:
  job-board: Job Board

component:
  log-in: Log In!
